# HTTP basic authentication
If a resource requires Basic HTTP Authentication, you can use the `u` option to pass the `user:password values`:
```sh
curl -u user:pass https://flaviocopes.com/
curl -u bob:qwerty http://192.165.34.3/dir/
```
# Perform an HTTP GET request
When you perform a request, curl will return the body of the response:
```sh
curl https://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Get the HTTP response headers
By default the response headers are hidden in the output of curl. To show them, use the `i` option:
```sh
curl -i https://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Only get the HTTP response headers
Using the `I` option, you can get only the headers, and not the response body:
```sh
curl -I https://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Perform an HTTP POST request
The `X` option lets you change the `HTTP` method used. By default, `GET` is used, and itâ€™s the same as writing
```sh
curl -X GET https://flaviocopes.com/
```
Using `-X POST` will perform a `POST` request. You can perform a POST request passing data URL encoded:
```sh
curl -d "option=value&something=anothervalue" -X POST https://flaviocopes.com/
```
In this case, the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Type` is sent.

# Perform an HTTP POST request sending JSON
Instead of posting data URL-encoded, like in the example above, you might want to send JSON. In this case you need to explicitly set the Content-Type header, by using the `H` option:
```sh
curl -d '{"option": "value", "something": "anothervalue"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://flaviocopes.com/
```
You can also send a JSON file from your disk:
```sh
curl -d "@my-file.json" -X POST https://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Perform an HTTP PUT request
The concept is the same as for `POST` requests, just change the `HTTP method` using `-X PUT`

# Follow a redirect
A redirect response like 301, which specifies the Location response header, can be automatically followed by specifying the `L` option:
```sh
curl http://flaviocopes.com/
```
will not follow automatically to the HTTPS version which I set up to redirect to, but this will:
```sh
curl -L http://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Store the response to a file
Using the `o` option you can tell curl to save the response to a file:
```sh
curl -o file.html https://flaviocopes.com/
```
You can also just save a file by its name on the server, using the O option:
```sh
curl -O https://flaviocopes.com/index.html
```

# Set a different User Agent
The user agent tells the server which client is performing the request. By default curl sends the `curl/<version> user agent, like: curl/7.54.0.`

You can specify a different user agent using the `--user-agent` option:
```sh
curl --user-agent "my-user-agent" https://flaviocopes.com
```
# Inspecting all the details of the request and the response
Use the `--verbose` option to make curl output all the details of the request, and the response:
```sh
curl --verbose -I https://flaviocopes.com/
```
# Use the specified proxy
```sh
-x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
curl -x 192.201.208.3:3128 127.0.0.1

# Get a file from an HTTP server that requires user and password, using the same proxy as above:
curl -u user:passwd -x my-proxy:888 http://www.get.this/
```
The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific SOCKS version to be used.
